Play Go Fish with AI bots



Create a four-player Go Fish game, where three players are AI bots, using the Pixi.js Javascript game engine. The user plays against these three AI bots. The AI bots should have different strategies for playing the game. The user should be able to see the game state and the actions taken by each player. The game should continue until one player runs out of cards or the deck is empty. The player with the most sets of four cards at the end of the game wins. Use React/TypeScript, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS for UI. Use Vite as the build tool.
